** Basic Collection Visualisation**

- to start: cd myapp, npm start
- all the main code is in App.js, the styling in index.css
- displays documents of sample collection (own file in public folder) in own div-containers
- for now shows nested documents via dashes ("-") in front of key-value pairs that are children of a parent
--> will be updated to look prettier
- objects in arrays cannot be shown yet
--> will also be fixed
